<h1>The best kdramas at the top of my memory</h1>
<h2>Top 3 kdramas and their short introduction</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo</h3>
<p>The best couple chemistry and pull-in story including IU and Lee Joon-Gi in this historic drama
    makes it my favourite even with a tragic end and no sequeal decided.</p>
<h3>Mr. Queen</h3>
<p>Another historic drama but with a very intriguing plot as well as great comic moments between a 
    so-called puppet king whose story and reputation in the people is altered for the better by a 
    time travelling man who posseses the body of his queen.</p>
<h3>Itaewon Class</h3>
<p>A slight romantic but mainly revenge driven male lead without taking any illegal measures to bring 
    his father's killer to ruins is one of the best plots you would ever watch and it is a personal 
    favourite of mine to rewatch.
